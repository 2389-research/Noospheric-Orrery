# ABOUTME: The handful of primitive graph reads every surface is built from, each
# ABOUTME: carrying the active-graph filter and bounded IN clauses so callers cannot forget.

"""Primitive graph reads.

The read path repeats about five ideas over and over: look a node up, count its degree,
get its container memberships, get its neighbours, list a container's contents.
Everything from the neighborhood endpoint to the MCP server is one of those with a
different scope.

The reason to have them in one place is **correctness, not tidiness**. Each of these
queries has two obligations that are easy to forget and invisible when forgotten:

- **Active by default.** Every query touching `entities` must repeat
  `invalid_at IS NULL`, or an entity removed through the corrections flow comes back.
  The opt-out is real and load-bearing: the dedup path passes `include_invalid=True` on
  purpose, so re-ingest re-attaches to an invalidated node instead of resurrecting it as
  a duplicate.
- **Bounded IN clauses.** Ids are chunked under SQLite's bound-parameter limit
  (SQLITE_MAX_VARIABLE_NUMBER, historically 999). Hand-rolled versions of these queries
  build one clause over an unbounded id list, which works until a domain gets big enough
  and then raises.

A copy-paste obligation gets forgotten; a shared reader cannot.
