# thread commits and sets the flag False, and the search thread then sets it True —
# publishing an index built from pre-correction rows as fresh. Both threads are real:
# `/search` is `async def` (event loop) while `/corrections/review` is a sync `def`

# `_entity_ids` and `_entity_index` are assigned separately, so two overlapping builds
# can pair one build's id list with the other's index and return the WRONG entities —
# not merely a lost ranking slot.

# re-enters this module, so reentrancy is not needed today — and if someone later adds a
# `mark_indexes_stale()` inside the build path, an RLock would silently swallow it (a
# lost mark, exactly the bug this guards against) whereas a Lock deadlocks loudly on the
