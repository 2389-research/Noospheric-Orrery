"""Search must hide soft-deleted entities, like every other surface.

Search was the one read that ignored `invalid_at`, so a node removed through the
corrections flow still surfaced there. Three separate holes, because there are three
ways an entity reaches a result: the FAISS index build, the lexical (exact/substring)
lookup, and per-hit hydration. An entity invalidated AFTER the last index build is
still in the index, so the read-time filters matter independently of the build one.

Targets `src.pipeline.search`, the PACKAGE. A same-named `search.py` sat beside it and
shadowed-out — unreachable, and it briefly attracted a fix meant for this code. It has
been deleted.
