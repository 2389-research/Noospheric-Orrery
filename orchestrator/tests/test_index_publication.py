"""A search must never mix one build's FAISS positions with another build's ids.

A FAISS position is meaningless on its own — it is an offset into the id list built
alongside that index. Held as two separate globals, a rebuild could swap one while a
search sat between reading them, and the search would return entities that were never
the match: not a ranking error, a WRONG ANSWER, with no error raised anywhere.

The fix is that the pair is published as a single tuple, and readers bind it once.
These tests pin both halves of that, because either alone is insufficient — an atomic
publish that readers ignore, or careful readers with a torn publish, both fail.

On isolation: `test_store` IS the tmp_path fixture — see conftest, `def test_store(
tmp_path)` building its database at `tmp_path / "test.db"`. Requesting it is how a test
here gets a per-test, file-backed SQLite database with WAL enabled. It is not a shared
or in-memory store, and `:memory:` could not work in its place: it is per-connection, so
`SQLiteDataStore`'s `init_db()` and `get_connection()` would land on two different empty
databases, and `PRAGMA journal_mode=WAL` silently returns "memory".
