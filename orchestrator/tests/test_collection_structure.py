"""GET /collections/{collection_id}/structure — collection -> modules -> files(+entities) for the
collection drill-in viz (`frontend/public/viz/collection.html`).

Key behaviours under test:
- Only the top `max_files` files by entity count are returned as render nodes
  (the main-graph top-N-by-degree strategy), while `total_files` still reports
  the full count. A 7k-file repo must not ship every file.
- Connected collections come from the (cheap) collection_edges table + the precomputed graph
  snapshot's collection routes — not a per-request entity_sources self-join.
