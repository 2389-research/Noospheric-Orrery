"""The graph payload contract (v5).

Through the migration this file compared the payload against an independent v4 builder
(the oracle) — every ablation phase had to be provably equivalent before the next
began. The adapter and the oracle are both gone now, so that question is answered and
closed; what remains is protecting the payload from drift.

That job is done by a GOLDEN: build the payload for a fixed seeded graph and compare it
to a committed JSON snapshot. Regenerate deliberately with

    UPDATE_GRAPH_GOLDEN=1 pytest tests/test_graph_v5_contract.py

and review the diff — an unreviewed regeneration defeats the point.

The behavioural tests below survive from the migration because each pins something a
golden alone would not explain: honest counts, order that carries meaning, and the
fields behind the maturity visual. Every one of them exists because an empty or absent
value would otherwise have passed silently — that happened four times during the
migration (active_simmers, spec_version, repo_edges, and the un-rendered node tail).
