"""repos/* -> collections/* — the in-place rename of the collection layer.

NOTE: this is the ONE file that must keep spelling the old names. Its fixture builds a
repo-era database on purpose, so a global rename sweep across the test suite will
silently gut it — rewriting the fixture into the new schema and inverting the
assertions into tautologies. If you are renaming things, skip this file.

The migration has real blast radius: it renames live tables holding every existing
corpus. The ordering constraint is the whole story — `migrate_to_collections` MUST run
before `executescript(SCHEMA)`, or `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS collections` creates an
empty table beside the populated `repos`, the rename fails, and every corpus is
stranded behind an empty one. Silently: reads would just return nothing.
